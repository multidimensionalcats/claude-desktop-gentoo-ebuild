		Claude Desktop is an AI assistant application by Anthropic that provides 
		access to Claude AI models through a native desktop interface. This 
		unofficial Linux build extracts and adapts the Windows version for Linux 
		by bundling a modern Electron runtime and replacing Windows-specific 
		components with Linux-compatible implementations.
		
		Features include full AI assistant functionality, MCP (Model Context 
		Protocol) support for local tool integration, native desktop integration 
		with system tray and keyboard shortcuts, and automatic Wayland/X11 detection.
		
		Note: This is an unofficial package that downloads proprietary software 
		from Anthropic and requires network access during build to download 
		Electron components via npm.
